## Overview

This issue tracks the work to release `vX.Y.Z` of the module.

## Tasks

The following tasks need to be completed to release the module.

- [ ] Create release branch
- [ ] Update release information
- [ ] Open PR
- [ ] Merge PR
- [ ] Create release tag
- [ ] Wait for release
- [ ] Sync release to GitLab
- [ ] Close release issue & milestone

### Create Release Branch

Create a release branch from the `main` branch to make the release changes on.

```shell
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b release-v1-1-0
git push --set-upstream origin release-v1-1-0
```

### Update Release Information

Replace `UNRELEASED` with the release date (usually today) in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) using the `yyyy-MM-dd` format.

Set the `module_version` in [local.tf](./local.tf) (in this example to `1.1.0`). If this is a pre-release version don't add the pre-release ordinal, so `v1.1.0-rc.7` would be coded as `v1.1.0-rc`.

Push the code up to GitHub.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Release v1.1.0"
git push
```

### Open PR

Open a [PR](https://github.com/LexisNexis-RBA/rsg-terraform-kubernetes-ingress-nginx/pulls) to merge the release branch in the `main` branch and add it to the release milestone. Add any additional content for the release to the PR. Assign yourself and add a reviewer; if you don;t have the correct permissions to merge the changes and create the tag you will need to add another assignee after the PR has been approved.

### Merge PR

The PR assignee (who needs to be a maintainer) can merge the branch into `main` once they are happy with the release.

### Create release tag

The PR assignee (who needs to be a maintainer) needs to run the following commands locally to create the release tag, the actual release will be created by GitHub actions.

```shell
git checkout main
git pull
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### Wait For Release

The release automation will be created as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/LexisNexis-RBA/rsg-terraform-kubernetes-ingress-nginx/actions/workflows/publish-release.yaml) which when it succeeds will create the GitHub release for the tag.

### Sync release to GitLab

> **IMPORTANT**
> You need to add a GitLab a remote if you have not done so already.
>
> Inside the AKS GitHub project you can add the GitLab remote by running the following command:
>
> `git remote add gitlab git@gitlab.b2b.regn.net:terraform/official-modules/k8s/terraform-lnrs-k8s-ingress-nginx.git`
>
> Verify that the remote is set by running the following command:
>
> `git remote -v`
>
> The output should look like:
>
> ```shell
> gitlab  git@gitlab.b2b.regn.net:terraform/official-modules/k8s/terraform-lnrs-k8s-ingress-nginx.git (fetch)
> gitlab  git@gitlab.b2b.regn.net:terraform/official-modules/k8s/terraform-lnrs-k8s-ingress-nginx.git (push)
> origin  git@github.com:LexisNexis-RBA/rsg-terraform-kubernetes-ingress-nginx.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:LexisNexis-RBA/rsg-terraform-kubernetes-ingress-nginx.git (push)
> ```

After pushing the release tag to GitHub, push the release tag to GitLab:

```shell
git fetch -u gitlab
git push -u gitlab main:master
git push -u gitlab v1.1.0
git branch main --set-upstream-to origin/main
git pull
```

On the [K8s Ingress NGINX Terraform Module](https://gitlab.b2b.regn.net/terraform/official-modules/k8s/terraform-lnrs-k8s-ingress-nginx) go to [tags](https://gitlab.b2b.regn.net/terraform/official-modules/k8s/terraform-lnrs-k8s-ingress-nginx/-/tags). Populate the release notes of the pushed release tag (`v1.1.0`), to align with the GitHub release. Create the minor version sliding tag (`v1.1`), and recreate the major version sliding tag (`v1`) that is currently there. Ensure these are created from `master`.

### Close Release Issue & Milestone

Once these steps have been completed this issue should be closed and the release milestone should be closed.
